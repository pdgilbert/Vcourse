########## Race Committee control program - stadiumRC ##########

stadiumRC startup tries to connect to gpsd. No auto RC position is available
if it does not (lat=90, lon=0 is reported if gpsd is not connected.) So

1/ start gpsd (-n don't wait for device)
   With gps puck in laptop usb:
     sudo gpsd -n -S 2947 /dev/ttyACM0 # default port
     sudo gpsd -n -S 2948 /dev/ttyACM0 # Note NOT default port
    (Note that gpsd startup is problematic.)
     and set RCconfig
    test with eg 
    gpsmon 127.0.0.1:2947

   Alternatively, start something like gps2net on phone and set RCconfig 
    (Note that I have not yet got stadiumRC to connect)

    test with eg 
    gpsmon 192.168.2.180:6000


2/ edit RCconfig in startup dir if necessary
3/ possibly edit defaultRace  in RC startup dir

4/ start stadiumRC (in some directory (eg RC)
      /path/to/stadiumRC 
   eg
      ../stadiumRC   



########## Individual boat gizmo LED control program - stadiumBT ##########

#####
stadiumBT can be simulated on a laptop with gps. LEDs are not used but
colour status is reported in the console. This needs gpsd started as
above and then, eg:
    cd boat
   ../stadiumBT   

  (stop with ^c in console)

#####
stadiumBT on a gizmo (raspberryPi) with LEDs:

configure and "burn" micro SD as in PiZeroWnotes.txt

plug in micro SD
plug in gps puck
power up

When working, this should start up software, poll gps,  and begin 
checking with RC for course info.


## debugging ##
(discover Pi IP by connecting to monitor or looking at wifi hub)
Connect from laptop to Pi. user/password as set in PiZeroWnotes.txt
(May not be needed if keys are set.)
Vcourse/ from github is useful for development, but may need lots of pulling.

Look at file ~/runAtBoot  for current version of startup instructions.
