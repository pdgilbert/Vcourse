If
     gpsmon  127.0.0.1:2947
shows data then all is working correctly. Following instructions are for
the case when there are problems.

Typically the boot process should start gpsd (when all works correctly)
  service --status-all # will show + for gpsd if it is running
or
  service --status-all | grep gpsd

The service and whether it is enabled on boot is controlled by
   sudo systemctl stop gpsd
   sudo systemctl stop gspd.socket
   sudo systemctl disable gpsd
   sudo systemctl enable gpsd
   sudo systemctl start gpsd
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl reenable gpsd.service

   systemctl status gpsd


Verify actual gps device to use with
  dmesg | tail

Assuming gps shows gps on /dev/ttyACM0  (eg USB ACM   ttyACM0 ), the command
line gpsd start up for default port 2947 and gps usb 
plugged in on /dev/ttyACM0 is
   gpsd  /dev/ttyACM0   # possibly as root ??

verify
  ps -elf | grep gps

If not, check
  lsusb  # should indicate U-Blox AG or other GPS device

There seems to be a difficulty between hotplug and usb gps at boot up in 2017-07-05-raspbian-jessie-lite and several other OS releases as the switch
to systemd is causing headaches. gpsd is started (by gspd.socket?) when gps is pluggged into usb (and fails with device busy)

If 
   cat /dev/ttyACM0
and
   gpsmon  /dev/ttyACM0
shows data but
   gpsmon
   gpsmon  localhost
   gpsmon  127.0.0.1:2947

do not then the problem is probably gpsd startup or hotplug

(with X it shoud also be possible to run xgps or cgps and show data from gpsd.)

BTW
gpsmon -L # lists a table showing which GPS device types gpsmon has
       built-in support for, and which generic commands can be applied...

Problem seems to be that systemd grabs loaclhost:2947 and does not release it,
so gpsd reports "Device or resource busy" and fails.
Starting on another port works.
  sudo gpsd -D 5 -N -n -S 2948 /dev/ttyACM0  #-S 2947 is default port
  sudo gpsd  -S 2948 /dev/ttyACM0  #-S 2947 is default port
