Notes that apply to both  Raspbian and Armbian are in file OSsetup.txt

This file contains notes specific to Raspbian and the hardware it runs on. 
To date tested primarily on Raspberry Pi Zero W v1.1 (RPiZw)
with  2017-07-05-raspbian-jessie-lite.

(Also tried Raspbian on Orange Pi Zero. The wifi worked more easily but the USB
 did not recognize gps. Notes on this are at the bottom of this file.)

Burn the image to microSD card. (usb worked better than SD slot on my laptop)

1/ Burn the image to microSD card. (usb worked better than SD slot on my laptop)
   dd  bs=4M if=xxxx.img  of=/dev/sdc
  (  pi/raspberry)

2/ Use raspi-config (or otherwise) for configuration. 

  -set/change pi user passwd

3/ turn on wifi connection to network  (see below)

4/ Mics Raspbian/Raspberry Pi specific

   Get rid of avahi (TESTING ON BT-1 )
      systemctl list-unit-files | grep avahi
        avahi-daemon.service                   enabled 
        avahi-daemon.socket                    enabled 
      apt-get remove avahi-daemon
      systemctl list-unit-files | grep avahi
        avahi-daemon.service                   masked  
        avahi-daemon.socket                    masked

##########  wifi ##########
  -turn on wifi connection to network. 
     to update (edit /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf, see network below)


For the Raspberry Pi Raspbian (2017-07-05-raspbian-jessie-lite) uses /etc/network/interfaces to configure ifup, ifdown for managing the network, 
/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf for setting wifi authentication,
and dhcpcd for client DHCP requests.


To get rid of NetworkManager, first get wifi working with /etc/network/interfaces
and wpa_supplicant, and connect though wifi (since eth0 will be disconnected in 
the change. On some newer systems udev renames wlan0 using
/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules gives new wlan# for every different mac 
address I think. This needs to be fixed to reproduce SD cards for different 
machines.

Following is based on using wlan0 but check if that is what it is on your system.
The /etc/network/interfaces file should have

source-directory /etc/network/interfaces.d

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
allow-hotplug eth0
no-auto-down eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

auto wlan0
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
    wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

Beware that eth0 in above interacts badly with NetworkManager, so possibly
comment the two lines until NetworkManager is disabled.

but first need to get wifi working and not managed by nm. 
That can be diffucult. On Raspbian (Orange) it was already not managed by nm, 
but on Armbian (Orange) it was I think (or there is another problem)

NOT nmcli radio wifi off
 nmcli connection show
nmcli connection delete h2o  ??

  systemctl disable net-auto-wireless.service
  systemctl status net-auto-wireless.service
  reboot


Now disconnect  NetworkManager control
 nmcli device
 nmcli device disconnect eth0  # be sure to have wifi connection working first  
 nmcli networking off # stops managing networks
 nmcli device  # eveything should be unmanaged

 nmcli con down h2o
 nmcli con up h2o

Now uncomment eth0 lines in /etc/network/interfaces and
 ifup eth0

and check it is working, then reboot, and hope it is still working, then

  apt-get remove network-manager   # (but don't autoremove wpasupplicant)
  apt-get install wpasupplicant    # with take it out of auto-remove list I think



If both wlan2 and eth0 connect then it is uncertain which will have the last 
write of /etc/resolv.conf, so if wifi is not Internet connected and you are trying
to do an update from the Internet, it may be necessary to edit /etc/resolv.conf
and specify a correct dns server. (Beware the file gets re-written on boot.)


Edit file /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf to
something like

country=CA
#country=GB
#ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
#update_config=1

# higher priority is more preferable

network={
   ssid="OnWaterNetwork"
   psk="someSecret"
   key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
   priority=10
#   id_str="possibly RC"
}

The ssid, pskm and key_mgmt fields should correspond to settings on the AP. 
I am not sure about fields update_config and ctrl_interface. 
I commented them out while trying to debug, but I'm not sure if they were 
the cause of problems.


nano -w /etc/network/interfaces

manual means nothing is done by this script, it is done elsewhere

Use raspi-config (or otherwise) for configuration. 

(I think this was version indicaded as Orange Pi Raspian updated : 2015-03-17 at http://www.orangepi.org/downloaded/download.html )


For the Oranage Pi version (I think) Orange Pi Raspian updated: 2015-03-17 at http://www.orangepi.org/downloaded/download.html 
uses network-manager for eth0. wlan2 (renamed from wlan0 by udev) is not set up. /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf can be
used for wifi (only partially working so far). These two approaches conflict or at least interact badly. There is also some tension between NetworkManager and
wpa_supplicant. This setup also used dhclient for client DHCP requests.
