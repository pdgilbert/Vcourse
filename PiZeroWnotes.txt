Notes on using  Pi Zero W v1.1  with  2017-07-05-raspbian-jessie-lite

Burn the image to microSD card. (usb worked better than SD slot on my laptop)

Image 2017-07-05-raspbian-jessie-lite has user pi, password raspberry.

Use raspi-config (or otherwise) for configuration. 

  -set/change pi user passwd
